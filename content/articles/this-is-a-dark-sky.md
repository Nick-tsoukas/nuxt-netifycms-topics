Until recently, the prevailing view assumed *lorem ipsum* was born as a nonsense text. “It's not Latin, though it looks like it, and it actually says nothing,” *Before & After* magazine [answered a curious reader](https://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/2290/what-does-the-filler-text-lorem-ipsum-mean/ "Straight Dope – What Does the Filler Text Lorem Ipsum Mean?"), “Its ‘words’ loosely approximate the frequency with which letters occur in English, which is why at a glance it looks pretty real.”

As Cicero would put it, “Um, not so fast.”

The placeholder text, beginning with the line *“Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit”*, looks like Latin because in its youth, centuries ago, it was Latin.

Richard McClintock, a Latin scholar from Hampden-Sydney College, is [credited](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorem_ipsum "Wikipedia – Lorem Ipsum") with discovering the source behind the ubiquitous filler text. In seeing a sample of *lorem ipsum*, his interest was piqued by *consectetur*—a genuine, albeit rare, Latin word. Consulting a Latin dictionary led McClintock to a passage from *De Finibus Bonorum et Malorum* (“On the Extremes of Good and Evil”), a first-century B.C. text from the Roman philosopher Cicero.

In particular, the garbled words of *lorem ipsum* bear an unmistakable resemblance to sections 1.10.32–33 of Cicero's work, with the most notable passage excerpted below:
